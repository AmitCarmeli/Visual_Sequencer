# Visual_Sequencer

The beauty model in photography is deeply embedded in our daily lives. I am offering an alternative translation to an image obtained from a real-time video camera.
With run-time pixel analysis, the image can be real-time altered to an abstract image, the projected image is displayed as a grid of pixel squares in shades of black and white, each pixel square making a musical sound according to the information within it.
People / objects visibility is translated into music when each one gets its own musical uniqueness according to its reflected form.
